Norman's translation is the Pali Text Society's preferred version, and it captures something the popular paraphrases miss: there's no \"self\" being created here, just a precise observation about how experience arises moment-to-moment. Mind precedes. Mind leads. Mind makes. What you attend to shapes what you experience. I first encountered this sentiment in a Peloton meditation — \"you see more of what you focus on\" — and traced it back here."
