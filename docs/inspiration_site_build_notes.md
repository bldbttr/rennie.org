style_approach = original_approach

# Variation 2: Diversity within same aesthetic category
if original_approach == 'artistic':
    style_name = random.choice(artistic_styles - original_style)
else:
    style_name = random.choice(scene_styles - original_style)

# Variation 3: Cross-category exploration
style_approach = 'scene' if original_approach == 'artistic' else 'artistic'
style_name = random.choice(opposite_category_styles)
```

**Frontend Selection**:
```javascript
// Random selection from available variations
if (content.images && content.images.length > 0) {
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * content.images.length);
    imagePath = content.images[randomIndex].path;
}

### Technical Implementation

**Smart Change Detection**:
```python
# Enhanced logic compares metadata vs current content
if metadata_style != current_style:
    needs_generation.append({
        'title': content['title'],
        'reason': 'style_change',
        'existing_style': metadata_style,
        'expected_style': current_style,
        'type': 'update'
    })
```

**Cost Control Workflow**:
```bash
🤔 APPROVAL REQUIRED
===================
Generate 6 images for approximately $0.23?
   • 3 new images for missing content
   • 3 updated images for style changes
Proceed with generation? (yes/no):
```

### Test Results

**Style Change Detection**:
- Successfully detects when content style specifications change
- Properly identifies when random styles resolve to different values
- Archives old images before generating new ones
- Provides clear before/after style reporting

**Local Preview Workflow**:
- Complete analysis and cost estimation in ~5 seconds

- Cost impact examples showing how changes affect pricing
- Step-by-step process for customizing variations
- Integration with existing regeneration workflows

### Technical Implementation

**Configuration Structure**:
```json
{
  "image_generation": {
    "variations_per_content": 3,
    "cost_per_image": 0.039,
    "model": "gemini-2.5-flash"
  },
  "project": {
    "name": "rennie.org inspiration site",
    "version": "1.0"
  }
}
```

**Python Integration**:
```python
def __init__(self, api_key: Optional[str] = None, check_only: bool = False):
    # Load configuration
    self.config = load_config()
    self.variations_per_content = self.config["image_generation"]["variations_per_content"]
    self.cost_per_image = self.config["image_generation"]["cost_per_image"]
```

```javascript
// Store which variation is currently displayed
this.currentImageIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * content.images.length);

// Use correct image data in modal
const image = content.images[this.currentImageIndex];
```

**Breathing Control**:
```javascript
// Pause when modal opens
this.pauseBreathing();

// Resume when modal closes
modal.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    if (e.target === modal) {
        modal.classList.add('hidden');
        this.startBreathing(); // Resume breathing
    }
});
```

**Enhanced Modal Display**:
```javascript
const modalContent = `
    <p><strong>Image:</strong> ${image.filename} (variation ${this.currentImageIndex + 1} of ${content.images.length})</p>
    <div class="prompt-section">
        <p><strong>Prompt (${promptLength} chars):</strong></p>
        <div class="prompt-text">${promptDisplay}</div>
    </div>
`;
```

### User Experience Improvements

```javascript
class ImageCarousel {
  constructor(images, options = {}) {
    this.kenBurnsAnimations = ['ken-burns-in', 'ken-burns-out', 'ken-burns-pan-left', 'ken-burns-pan-right'];
    this.touchStartX = 0; // Touch gesture state
    this.preloadedImages = new Map(); // Performance optimization
    this.prefersReducedMotion = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches;
  }
}
```

## Phase 12: Production Polish & Bug Resolution ✅ COMPLETED (September 11, 2025)

### Overview
Final production polish including modal improvements for better prompt viewing and resolution of carousel indicator visibility issues caused by CSS transition conflicts.

### Key Achievements

**✅ Enhanced Modal Prompt Display**
- **Larger Modal Size**: Expanded from 600px to 800px width (33% larger) with 95% viewport coverage
- **Better Prompt Readability**: Reduced font from 0.85rem to 0.75rem with improved line height (1.5)
- **Intelligent Truncation**: Increased threshold from 300 to 500 characters, showing first 200 + last 150 chars
- **Scrollable Content**: Added max-height with scroll for long prompts, eliminating need for truncation in most cases
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive modal sizing with appropriate font scaling

**✅ Critical CSS Conflict Resolution**  
- **Root Cause Identified**: Carousel indicators were disappearing due to `fade-to-black` CSS transitions applying `opacity: 0 !important` to parent `image-panel`
- **CSS Override Solution**: Added specific rules to preserve indicator visibility during quote transitions
- **Z-Index Enhancement**: Increased carousel indicators from z-index 10 to 100 for better layering
- **Interaction Preservation**: Maintained clickable functionality during fade transitions

### Development Lessons Learned

**⚠️ CSS Cascade and !important Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Complex CSS transitions with `!important` declarations can have unintended cascading effects on child elements
- **Root Cause**: Parent element opacity changes affected all children, even those with independent styling
- **Detection Method**: User reported missing UI elements led to systematic debugging of CSS specificity conflicts
- **Solution**: Targeted CSS overrides with matching `!important` specificity to preserve child element visibility
- **Best Practice**: When using strong CSS overrides, consider impact on all child elements and add specific preservation rules

**⚠️ User Experience Feedback Integration**
- **Problem**: Modal prompt display was too constrained for long AI generation prompts  
- **User Request**: "Could we also consider perhaps a smaller font size or slightly larger window to support seeing more of the prompt"
- **Systematic Approach**: 
  1. Analyzed current modal sizing and font choices
  2. Calculated optimal improvements (33% size increase, smaller font)
  3. Improved truncation logic to show 67% more content
  4. Added scrollable area for very long prompts
- **Result**: Significantly enhanced user ability to understand AI generation process

**⚠️ Production Debugging Methodology**
- **Issue Detection**: Visual regression noticed immediately after recent changes
- **Investigation Process**: Systematic checking of HTML structure → CSS rules → JavaScript logic → CSS conflict identification
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Traced issue to specific CSS class interactions during quote transitions
- **Solution Validation**: Targeted fix preserving all existing functionality while resolving visibility issue

### Files Modified
- `output/style.css` - Enhanced modal sizing and carousel indicator override rules
- `output/script.js` - Improved prompt truncation logic with better thresholds

### Production Impact
- **Enhanced User Experience**: 67% more visible prompt text with better modal presentation
- **Restored Carousel Functionality**: All carousel indicators now remain visible during transitions  
- **Maintained Performance**: No impact on load times or transition smoothness
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Enhanced CSS works across all modern browsers

### Template-Generated Code Management Lessons

**⚠️ Critical Issue: Recurring Feature Loss Due to Template System**
- **Problem Pattern**: Features implemented by editing `/output/` files directly get lost during deployment because these files are template-generated by `scripts/build_site.py`
- **Root Cause**: Build system regenerates output files from templates during GitHub Actions deployment, overwriting any direct edits
- **Occurrence Frequency**: Multiple times during project development, requiring repeated re-implementation
- **User Impact**: "We seem to keep losing this feature" - significant frustration and development time waste

**🔍 Detection Methods for Template-Generated Files**:
1. **File Header Comments**: Look for generation markers like `<!-- Generated by build_site.py -->`
2. **Build Script Analysis**: Check `scripts/build_site.py` for file generation logic
3. **Git Diff Patterns**: Files that change completely during deployment are likely template-generated
4. **Directory Structure**: Files in `/output/` directory are typically generated, not source files

**✅ Prevention Strategies**:

**Always Edit Source Templates, Not Output Files**:
- **Output Directory**: `/output/` contains generated files - NEVER edit directly
- **Template Directory**: `/scripts/templates/` contains source files - ALWAYS edit here
- **Build Process**: `scripts/build_site.py` generates output from templates during deployment

**Verification Checklist Before Editing**:
1. Check if file exists in `/scripts/templates/` directory
2. Search for file path in `scripts/build_site.py` generation logic  
3. Look for template generation comments in file headers
4. If uncertain, create separate development file first (e.g., `script_carousel.js`)

**Development Workflow for Template Changes**:
1. **Create Development File**: Make separate file in `/output/` for testing (e.g., `script_carousel.js`)
2. **Test Functionality**: Verify feature works in development environment
3. **Update Source Template**: Move working code to appropriate template in `/scripts/templates/`
4. **Test Template Integration**: Run build process to ensure template generates correctly
5. **Deploy and Verify**: Confirm feature survives deployment process

**Code Comments for Future Developers**:
```html
<!-- IMPORTANT: This file is template-generated by scripts/build_site.py -->
<!-- To modify this file, edit scripts/templates/app.js instead -->
<!-- Direct edits to this file will be lost during deployment -->
```

**Documentation References**:
- Add clear warnings in `/CLAUDE.md` about template system
- Include template identification guide in project documentation
- Document which files are generated vs source files

**Emergency Recovery Process**:
If feature is lost due to template editing:
1. **Don't Panic**: Feature code still exists in git history
2. **Locate Last Working Version**: Use `git log` to find when feature was working
3. **Extract Working Code**: Copy implementation from git history
4. **Apply to Source Template**: Update appropriate template file in `/scripts/templates/`
5. **Test and Deploy**: Verify feature survives full deployment cycle

**Project-Specific Template Files**:
- `scripts/templates/style.css` → generates `output/style.css`
- `scripts/templates/app.js` → generates `output/script.js`
- `scripts/templates/index.html` → generates `output/index.html`

**Best Practices for Personal Project Scale**:
- Template system is appropriate for deployment automation
- Clear documentation prevents repeated mistakes
- Simple detection methods sufficient for personal project
- Don't over-engineer - basic prevention strategies work well

### Recurring HTML/JavaScript Element ID Synchronization Bug (September 12, 2025)

**⚠️ Critical Recurring Issue**: Style synchronization breaking after template updates - style info only updates with quote changes, not image transitions.

**Root Pattern**: HTML template uses `id="content-info"`, JavaScript references `getElementById('style-info')` → silent failure.

**Why This Keeps Happening**:
1. **Template System Complexity**: HTML and JavaScript templates updated independently during refactoring
2. **Silent Failure**: No error when DOM element not found - bug is invisible during development  
3. **Cross-File Dependencies**: Element ID changes in HTML don't trigger JavaScript updates
4. **Inconsistent Refactoring**: Multiple commits over time created mixed naming conventions

**Historical Timeline**:
- **September 9**: UI improvements changed HTML element IDs
- **September 11**: Template refactor potentially reset JavaScript references  
- **September 12**: Bug reintroduced after template system regeneration

**Prevention Strategy for Future**:
1. **Element ID Documentation**: Maintain list of critical DOM elements and their JavaScript dependencies
2. **Synchronization Checklist**: When updating HTML templates, verify all corresponding JavaScript references
3. **Error Handling**: Add console warnings for missing DOM elements during development
4. **Naming Standards**: Establish consistent element ID conventions and stick to them

**Quick Detection Method**: When carousel navigation works but style info doesn't update → check element ID mismatch.

**Template Files to Check Together**:
- `scripts/templates/index.html` - HTML element definitions
- `scripts/templates/app.js` - JavaScript DOM queries  
- Both must use identical element IDs for functionality to work

**Lesson**: In template-based systems, HTML and JavaScript are tightly coupled through DOM element IDs. Breaking this coupling through inconsistent naming creates silent failures that significantly impact user experience. Always update both sides of HTML/JS dependencies together.
