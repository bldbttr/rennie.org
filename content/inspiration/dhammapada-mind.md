Mental phenomena are preceded by mind, have mind as their leader, are made by mind.

## Why I Like It
The opening verse of the Dhammapada — the first teaching in one of Buddhism's foundational texts. K.R. Norman's translation is the Pali Text Society's preferred version, and it captures something the popular paraphrases miss: there's no "self" being created here, just a precise observation about how experience arises moment-to-moment. Mind precedes. Mind leads. Mind makes. What you attend to shapes what you experience. I first encountered this sentiment in a Peloton meditation — "you see more of what you focus on" — and traced it back here.
