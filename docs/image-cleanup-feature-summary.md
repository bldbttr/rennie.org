# Image Cleanup Feature - Implementation Summary

**Date**: September 9, 2025  
**Feature**: Orphaned Image Cleanup for rennie.org inspiration site

## Overview

Added comprehensive cleanup functionality to remove orphaned images when:
1. Content `.md` files are deleted from `content/inspiration/`
2. Variation count is reduced (e.g., from 5 to 3 variations per content)

## Implementation Complete ✅

### Python Intelligence (`scripts/generate_images.py`)

**New Methods Added:**
- `identify_orphaned_images()` - Detects images for missing content and excess variations
- `cleanup_orphaned_images()` - Safely removes orphaned images with archiving

**New Command-Line Options:**
- `--check-orphaned` - Check for orphaned images  
- `--cleanup-orphaned` - Remove orphaned images with confirmation
- `--dry-run` - Preview what would be removed
- `--variations N` - Now configurable (no longer hard-coded to 3)

### Bash Orchestration

**New Script:** `bin/cleanup-images.sh`
- User-friendly interface with confirmation prompts
- Shows preview before deletion  
- Archives files for safety before removal

**Enhanced Script:** `bin/check-images.sh`
- Now shows orphaned images section
- Displays estimated space savings
- Suggests cleanup command

### Safety Features Implemented

- **Archive First**: Orphaned images moved to `generated/archive/cleanup_TIMESTAMP/`
- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview removals without acting
- **User Confirmation**: Clear prompts before destructive actions
- **Detailed Reporting**: Shows exactly what was removed and why
- **Configurable**: Variations count no longer hard-coded

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Check current image status (now includes orphaned images)
./bin/check-images.sh

# Check only for orphaned images  
python scripts/generate_images.py --check-orphaned

# Preview what would be cleaned up
python scripts/generate_images.py --cleanup-orphaned --dry-run

# Clean up orphaned images with confirmation
./bin/cleanup-images.sh

# Direct Python cleanup
python scripts/generate_images.py --cleanup-orphaned
```

## Integration with Existing Architecture

### ✅ No Pipeline Changes Needed

**Current hybrid local-first workflow remains unchanged:**
- Images generated locally using `bin/generate-new-images-locally.sh`
- Images committed to repository before deployment
- GitHub Actions deploys existing committed images (doesn't generate)

**Cleanup is a local maintenance operation:**
- Run `bin/cleanup-images.sh` locally when needed
- Commit cleaned-up state like any other change
- GitHub Actions deploys the cleaned state automatically

### ✅ Documentation Updated

- Enhanced `CLAUDE.md` quick commands to include cleanup workflow
- Updated `docs/inspiration_site_spec.md` to document new scripts
- Created comprehensive feature documentation

## Architecture Alignment

Follows established project principle: **orchestration in bash, intelligence in Python**
- Python: Detection logic, file operations, safety checks
- Bash: User interaction, workflow orchestration, confirmation prompts

## Safety & Reliability

**Archive System:**
- All removed files archived to timestamped directories
- Can be restored if needed
- No data loss during cleanup operations

**Intelligent Detection:**
- Compares expected files (from content) vs existing files (in filesystem)
- Distinguishes between missing content vs excess variations
- Provides detailed reasoning for each file marked for removal

**User Control:**
- Dry-run mode shows exactly what would be removed
- User confirmation required before any destructive action
- Clear reporting of all operations performed

## Feature Status: Production Ready ✅

The image cleanup feature is fully implemented and ready for production use. It integrates seamlessly with the existing hybrid local-first workflow without requiring any changes to the deployment pipeline.
