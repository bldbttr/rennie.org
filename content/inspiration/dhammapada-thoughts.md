All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts.

## Why I Like It
The opening verse of the Dhammapada — a foundational Buddhist text. Heard a modern echo of this in an Anna Greenberg Peloton meditation: "you see more of what you focus on." The sentiment traces through William James ("My experience is what I agree to attend to") and countless traditions. What we attend to shapes what we experience. Simple, but worth returning to.
