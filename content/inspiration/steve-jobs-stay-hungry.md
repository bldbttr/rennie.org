Stay hungry. Stay foolish.

## Why I Like It
This closing advice from Steve Jobs' Stanford commencement speech captures the essence of continuous learning and maintaining beginner's mind. It reminds us to never become complacent with what we know.

## What I See In It
The perpetual curiosity of a child combined with the wisdom of experience - someone who questions everything while embracing the unknown with enthusiasm rather than fear.
