...And you can always feel product/market fit when it’s happening.

## Why I Like It
Timeless insight.  First piece that describes the mission of building, and captures the feeling when it's working and when it's not, without listing a metric.  I re-read it a couple times a year.

## What I See In It
While the paragraph is literal, there's a sensation everyone has felt, that pmarca captures well.  Maybe it was winning a board game, or building a product or seeing it happen in a movie, it's not a spreadsheet it's a movement.  And he describes with clarity: "I'm not suggesting that you do ignore everything else—just that judging from what I've seen in successful startups, you can."
