Make something people want.

## Why I Like It
PG's advice resonates with me and this specifically is the best single encapsulation of a startup or product mission I have come across. I try to challenge myself with this constantly.

## What I See In It
A person getting utility or joy from the experience the product brings to their life. While it's an instruction to the builder, it's an instruction to capture the essence of someone's desires, to be inside their values and express that through a product.

## Visual Notes (Optional)
Additional context for image generation - colors, mood, energy that this evokes for you personally.
