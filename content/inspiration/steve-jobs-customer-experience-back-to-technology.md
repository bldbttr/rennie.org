You've gotta start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology.

## Why I Like It
Masterful clarity, inspiration and motivation. This encapsulates the entire philosophy of great product development - understanding what people actually need and want.

## What I See In It
A leader who understands that technology is just a tool to solve human problems, not the end goal itself. The magic happens when you truly understand the customer's world.
